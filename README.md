# Titanic Data Insights ðŸš¢

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project analyzes the famous Titanic dataset to predict passenger survival using Machine Learning.  
The notebook focuses on model training, hyperparameter tuning, evaluation, and saving the final model.

## ðŸ”Ž Notebook Highlights
The notebook includes the following steps:

1. **Dropping Unnecessary Columns**  
   - Removed irrelevant data before training.  

2. **Model Training**  
   - Logistic Regression  
   - Decision Tree  
   - Random Forest  

3. **Hyperparameter Tuning**  
   - Applied tuning for all three models.  

4. **Evaluation**  
   - Classification Report (Precision, Recall, F1-score)  
   - Confusion Matrix (visualized)  
   - ROC Curve & AUC  

5. **Final Model Selection**  
   - Logistic Regression chosen as the best model.  
   - Model saved using `joblib` in `.pkl` format.

## ðŸ“Š Results
- **Best Model:** Logistic Regression  
- **Performance Metrics:** Balanced precision, recall, and F1-score  
- **Model File:** `logistic_regression_model.pkl`

## ðŸ’¾ How to Use the Saved Model
```python
import joblib

# Load the saved model
model = joblib.load("logistic_regression_model.pkl")

# Predict on new data
y_pred = model.predict(X_new)
